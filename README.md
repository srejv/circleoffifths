# Circle of fifths

This is a practise app for circle of fifths. I want to learn which chords I can go to when I'm jamming. I'm thinking it's like the multiplication table, just practise so it's possible to just know every time I think of a chord. 

Also add the inner circle for minor chords.

## Okay but I don't really care about a console app and it's hard to tell what's going on. Too much text

Let's try to give it a little GUI. I tried pygame first but it feels slow and not great, so let's try pygfx which is based on wgpu which I kinda feel is the standard nowadays.

Never tried this before so let's see how it works out. What we want is to be able to render sprites and text. Maybe some arc shapes would be nice but not strictly necessary because we could get away with images I guess. Hm. Would be nice to be able to have a little editor maybe ldtk or something to export the circle?
